My first forensic writeup, one of the easiest challenge in pico!

Basically its just this plain boring red image....but it can be interesting when we throw it inside aperisolve!

From aperisolve, we could observe in zsteg that this image has base64!



Just throw those inside cyberchef and get the flag!
